Concurrency and synchronization in C revolve around managing the execution of multiple threads or processes that share resources. Properly managing concurrency ensures programs run efficiently and safely, avoiding issues like data races or deadlocks. Below is an overview of key concepts and tools in C for concurrency and synchronization.

### **Concurrency in C**

Concurrency is achieved through **multithreading** or **multiprocessing**:

1. **Multithreading**:
   - Threads share the same memory space, enabling efficient communication but requiring synchronization to prevent conflicts.
   - In C, multithreading is commonly handled using the **POSIX Threads (pthreads)** library on Unix-like systems or **Windows Threads API** on Windows.
   - Thread functions:
     - `pthread_create`: Creates a new thread.
     - `pthread_join`: Waits for a thread to complete.
     - `pthread_exit`: Terminates the calling thread.
   - Example of a simple thread creation:
     ```c
     #include <pthread.h>
     #include <stdio.h>

     void *print_message(void *message) {
         printf("%s\n", (char *)message);
         return NULL;
     }

     int main() {
         pthread_t thread;
         char *message = "Hello from thread!";
         pthread_create(&thread, NULL, print_message, (void *)message);
         pthread_join(thread, NULL); // Wait for the thread to finish
         return 0;
     }
     ```

2. **Multiprocessing**:
   - Processes do not share memory but can communicate using **inter-process communication (IPC)** mechanisms like shared memory, pipes, or message queues.
   - Use the `fork()` system call to create processes in Unix-based systems.

### **Synchronization in C**

Synchronization prevents issues like **data races** and ensures correct access to shared resources. Tools for synchronization include:

1. **Mutexes**:
   - A mutex (mutual exclusion) allows only one thread to access a critical section at a time.
   - Key functions:
     - `pthread_mutex_init`: Initializes a mutex.
     - `pthread_mutex_lock`: Acquires the mutex (blocks if already locked).
     - `pthread_mutex_unlock`: Releases the mutex.
     - `pthread_mutex_destroy`: Destroys the mutex.
   - Example:
     ```c
     pthread_mutex_t lock;

     void *critical_section(void *arg) {
         pthread_mutex_lock(&lock);
         // Critical section
         printf("Thread %d in critical section\n", *(int *)arg);
         pthread_mutex_unlock(&lock);
         return NULL;
     }

     int main() {
         pthread_mutex_init(&lock, NULL);
         pthread_t threads[2];
         int ids[2] = {1, 2};

         for (int i = 0; i < 2; i++) {
             pthread_create(&threads[i], NULL, critical_section, &ids[i]);
         }
         for (int i = 0; i < 2; i++) {
             pthread_join(threads[i], NULL);
         }

         pthread_mutex_destroy(&lock);
         return 0;
     }
     ```

2. **Condition Variables**:
   - Used for signaling between threads.
   - Often combined with mutexes to wait for certain conditions.
   - Key functions:
     - `pthread_cond_wait`: Waits for a condition to be signaled.
     - `pthread_cond_signal`: Wakes one waiting thread.
     - `pthread_cond_broadcast`: Wakes all waiting threads.

3. **Semaphores**:
   - Semaphores are counters that control access to shared resources.
   - Two types:
     - **Binary semaphore**: Works like a mutex.
     - **Counting semaphore**: Allows a fixed number of threads to access the resource.
   - In C, use the `<semaphore.h>` library:
     ```c
     #include <semaphore.h>
     sem_t sem;

     void *worker(void *arg) {
         sem_wait(&sem); // Acquire
         printf("Thread %d working\n", *(int *)arg);
         sem_post(&sem); // Release
         return NULL;
     }

     int main() {
         sem_init(&sem, 0, 2); // Initialize with value 2
         pthread_t threads[4];
         int ids[4] = {1, 2, 3, 4};

         for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
             pthread_create(&threads[i], NULL, worker, &ids[i]);
         }
         for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
             pthread_join(threads[i], NULL);
         }

         sem_destroy(&sem);
         return 0;
     }
     ```

4. **Atomic Operations**:
   - For lightweight synchronization, use atomic operations from `<stdatomic.h>` (C11).
   - Example:
     ```c
     #include <stdatomic.h>
     atomic_int counter = 0;

     void *increment(void *arg) {
         atomic_fetch_add(&counter, 1);
         return NULL;
     }
     ```

### **Common Issues in Concurrency**

1. **Race Conditions**:
   - Occur when multiple threads access shared data simultaneously without synchronization, leading to unpredictable results.
   - Solved using mutexes or atomic operations.

2. **Deadlocks**:
   - Arise when two or more threads wait indefinitely for each other to release resources.
   - Prevented by consistent resource acquisition order or by using try-lock mechanisms.

3. **Starvation**:
   - Happens when a thread is perpetually denied access to resources because others monopolize them.

4. **Livelock**:
   - Threads keep changing states in response to each other but make no progress.
