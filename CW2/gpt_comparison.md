For a theoretical problem involving satellites and real-time processing of over 1,000 sensors, Java, C, and Python remain strong candidates for evaluation. Here's how their features align with this problem:

### **Key Requirements**:
1. **Real-time processing**: Efficient handling of high-frequency sensor data.
2. **Concurrency**: Processing streams of data concurrently from 1,000+ sensors.
3. **Reliability**: Robust error handling and synchronization to avoid data corruption.
4. **Performance**: Low-latency and high-throughput for real-time responsiveness.
5. **Scalability**: Handling the increasing complexity as more sensors or features are added.

### **Language Suitability Overview**:

#### **C**:
- **Strengths**:
  - Bare-metal performance: Direct control over memory and hardware.
  - Fine-grained concurrency with `pthreads`.
  - Deterministic behavior, essential for hard real-time systems.
  - Low-level system access, useful for embedded applications like satellites.
- **Weaknesses**:
  - Error-prone due to manual memory and resource management.
  - No built-in abstractions for task scheduling or advanced synchronization.
  - Developing and debugging real-time systems in C can be complex and time-intensive.

#### **Java**:
- **Strengths**:
  - High-level concurrency constructs (e.g., `ExecutorService`, parallel streams) simplify development.
  - Built-in garbage collection helps manage memory.
  - Real-time Java extensions (e.g., RTSJ) offer support for deterministic and predictable timing.
  - Rich libraries for networking and data handling.
- **Weaknesses**:
  - Garbage collection pauses can cause latency issues (mitigated with RTSJ).
  - Higher resource overhead compared to C.

#### **Python**:
- **Strengths**:
  - Rapid development and ease of use for prototyping.
  - Flexible concurrency options (e.g., `multiprocessing` for parallelism, `asyncio` for I/O-bound tasks).
  - Suitable for integrating with external libraries or systems written in C/C++.
- **Weaknesses**:
  - The GIL limits thread-based parallelism, making Python less suitable for CPU-bound real-time tasks.
  - Higher latency and lower performance compared to C and Java.
  - Better for less stringent real-time requirements or as a coordinator language.

### **Next Steps**:
For this assignment, focus on detailing:
1. How each language handles concurrency and synchronization for real-time tasks.
2. Trade-offs between performance, development complexity, and reliability.
3. A conclusion about which language is best suited for this problem and why.
