That structure is clear and logical! Here's a quick outline you can use to flesh it out:

### **1. Introduction**
- Briefly explain the theoretical problem: real-time processing of over 1,000 sensors on satellites.
- Highlight why concurrency and synchronization are critical for solving this problem.
- Introduce the three chosen languages (C, Python, Java) and their relevance.

### **2. Summary of C**
- Discuss:
  - Concurrency primitives like `pthreads`.
  - Low-level control over memory and resources.
  - Determinism and suitability for embedded systems.
- Highlight challenges (manual memory management, debugging complexity).

### **3. Summary of Python**
- Discuss:
  - Concurrency libraries (`threading`, `multiprocessing`, `asyncio`).
  - GIL and its impact on threading.
  - Ease of development but limited performance for CPU-bound tasks.
- Highlight scenarios where Python excels (e.g., prototyping, coordination).

### **4. Summary of Java**
- Discuss:
  - Built-in threading model and high-level abstractions (`ExecutorService`, parallel streams).
  - JVM benefits like garbage collection and portability.
  - Real-time capabilities via RTSJ.
- Highlight trade-offs (e.g., garbage collection latency).

### **5. Evaluation**
- Compare the three languages based on:
  - Real-time processing capability.
  - Ease of implementing concurrency and synchronization.
  - Suitability for handling over 1,000 sensors.
  - Development and maintenance complexity.
- Conclude with the most suitable language for this problem and justify your choice.
